docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: '3.2'
services:
  dockcheck-web:
    container_name: dockcheck-web
    image: 'palleri/dockcheck-web:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/www/html
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
```

# Security concern
For more security add the :ro to volumes docker.sock

Use with care, make sure you keep this container safe and do not published on the internet.


# ARM support 
Available at [hub.docker/Palleri](https://hub.docker.com/r/palleri/dockcheck-web/tags)
